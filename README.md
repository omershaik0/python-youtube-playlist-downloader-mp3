# python-youtube-playlist-downloader-mp3

Efficiently Convert and Download YouTube Videos to MP3 Format Using Python Scripting with Pytube Library. My script prompts for file containing YouTube links, reads the links, and iterates through each one to create YouTube object. It filters the streams to only audio, selects the first one, downloads it to the current working directory and renames the file with .mp3 extension, and prints the title of the video which has been successfully downloaded.
